# üöÄ RecipeShare - Complete Deployment Guide

This guide will walk you through deploying your RecipeShare platform to GitHub and Vercel.

---

## üìã Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- [x] GitHub account
- [x] Vercel account (free tier is fine)
- [x] Supabase project URL and anon key
- [x] All features tested locally
- [x] No errors in the application

---

## üîß Step 1: Prepare Environment Variables

You'll need these from your Supabase project:

1. Go to your Supabase project
2. Click on "Settings" ‚Üí "API"
3. Copy these values:
   - **Project URL:** `https://your-project.supabase.co`
   - **Anon/Public Key:** `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...`

---

## üì¶ Step 2: Initialize Git Repository

If you haven't already initialized Git:

```bash
# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Create first commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: RecipeShare platform ready for deployment"

# Set main branch
git branch -M main
```

---

## üêô Step 3: Push to GitHub

### Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com)
2. Click the "+" icon ‚Üí "New repository"
3. Name your repository: `recipe-sharing` (or any name you prefer)
4. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
5. Click "Create repository"

### Push Your Code

```bash
# Add GitHub remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/recipe-sharing.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

**Note:** If you encounter authentication issues, you may need to use a Personal Access Token instead of your password.

## üåê Step 4: Deploy to Vercel

### Option A: Vercel Dashboard (Recommended for First-Time)

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign in
2. Click "Add New Project"
3. Import your GitHub repository:
   - Select "Import Git Repository"
   - Choose your `recipe-sharing` repository
   - Click "Import"

4. Configure your project:
   - **Framework Preset:** Next.js (auto-detected)
   - **Root Directory:** `./` (leave as default)
   - **Build Command:** `npm run build` (default)
   - **Output Directory:** `.next` (default)
   - **Install Command:** `npm install` (default)

5. **Add Environment Variables:**
   Click "Environment Variables" and add:
   
   ```
   Name: NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
   Value: https://your-project.supabase.co
   
   Name: NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
   Value: your-anon-key-here
   ```

6. Click "Deploy"

### Option B: Vercel CLI (Advanced)

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI globally
npm install -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Deploy (first time)
vercel

# Follow the prompts:
# - Set up and deploy? Yes
# - Which scope? Your account
# - Link to existing project? No
# - Project name? recipe-sharing
# - Directory? ./
# - Override settings? No

# Add environment variables
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
# Enter your Supabase URL when prompted

vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
# Enter your Supabase anon key when prompted

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

---

## üîê Step 5: Configure Supabase for Your Vercel URL

After deployment, you'll get a Vercel URL like: `https://recipe-sharing.vercel.app`

1. Go to your Supabase project
2. Navigate to "Authentication" ‚Üí "URL Configuration"
3. Add your Vercel URL to:
   - **Site URL:** `https://recipe-sharing.vercel.app`
   - **Redirect URLs:** Add:
     - `https://recipe-sharing.vercel.app`
     - `https://recipe-sharing.vercel.app/**` (with wildcard)
4. Click "Save"

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: "Error loading recipes"
**Solution:** Check that your Supabase URL and anon key are correctly set in Vercel environment variables.

#### Issue: "Authentication not working"
**Solution:** Verify that your Vercel URL is added to Supabase redirect URLs.

#### Issue: "Images not uploading"
**Solution:** 
1. Check that `recipe-images` bucket exists in Supabase Storage
2. Verify bucket is set to public
3. Check RLS policies on the bucket

#### Issue: "Build failed on Vercel"
**Solution:**
1. Check Vercel build logs
2. Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
3. Verify TypeScript has no errors locally

#### Issue: "Page not found (404)"
**Solution:** Vercel may need a few minutes to propagate. Wait 2-3 minutes and try again.
