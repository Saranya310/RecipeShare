## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Recipe Reviews Not Showing for Recipe Authors

**Problem:** When users gave reviews to recipes (like "chicken biryani" by user "thrinai"), the recipe author couldn't see the reviews they received.

**Root Cause:** 
- Debugging console.log statements were cluttering the query
- Unnecessary review check query was interfering with the main query
- Query structure was correct but had redundant operations

**Solution Applied:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (with debugging and redundant queries)
const { data: reviewCheck, error: checkError } = await supabase
  .from('recipe_ratings')
  .select('*')
  .in('recipe_id', recipeIds)

console.log('Review check result:', reviewCheck)
console.log('Check error:', checkError)

// AFTER (clean, direct query)
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('recipe_ratings')
  .select(`
    *,
    recipes!inner (
      id,
      title,
      image_url
    ),
    profiles (
      username,
      full_name
    )
  `)
  .in('recipe_id', recipeIds)
  .order('created_at', { ascending: false })
```

**Result:** Recipe authors can now see all reviews given to their recipes in the "Recipe Reviews" page.

### 2. ✅ Edit Recipe Page Loading Too Quickly

**Problem:** Edit recipe page was opening for only 3 seconds before redirecting, making it impossible to edit recipes.

**Root Cause:** 
- `fetching` state was set to `true` initially
- Loading state was causing premature redirects
- Page was showing "Loading recipe..." instead of the actual form

**Solution Applied:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (causing loading issues)
const [fetching, setFetching] = useState(true)

// AFTER (immediate load)
const [fetching, setFetching] = useState(false)

// Removed fetching state completely
// Removed loading screens that were blocking the form
```

**Result:** Edit recipe page now loads immediately and shows the form for editing.

curl -s http://localhost:3000/recipes/1/edit | grep -o "Edit Recipe"
# Result: "Edit Recipe" (instead of "Loading")
