# 🔧 Database Field Fix - Recipe Reviews

**Issue:** Reviews were not displaying because the code was looking for `review` field but the database table has `comment` field.

---

## 🐛 **Root Cause**

The `recipe_ratings` table in Supabase has a column named `comment`, but the application code was looking for a field named `review`.

**Database Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE recipe_ratings (
  id UUID DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4() PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL,
  recipe_id UUID REFERENCES recipes ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL,
  rating INTEGER CHECK (rating >= 1 AND rating <= 5) NOT NULL,
  comment TEXT,  -- ← This is the actual field name
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(user_id, recipe_id)
);
```

**Application Code (Before Fix):**
```typescript
interface Review {
  review: string | null  // ← Wrong field name
}
```

## ✅ **Files Fixed**

### 1. `app/recipe-reviews/page.tsx`
- **Interface:** Changed `review: string | null` to `comment: string | null`
- **Display:** Changed `review.review` to `review.comment`

### 2. `components/recipe-rating.tsx`
- **Interface:** Changed `review: string | null` to `comment: string | null`
- **State:** Changed `newReview` to `newComment`
- **Database Operations:** Changed `review: newReview.trim()` to `comment: newComment.trim()`
- **Display:** Changed all `rating.review` to `rating.comment`
