## 🔧 Critical Fixes Implemented

### 1. Edit Recipe Page - Next.js 15 Async Params ✅
**Issue:** Edit recipe page was showing errors and stuck in loading state  
**Root Cause:** Next.js 15 changed `params` to be async (Promise-based)  
**Solution:** 
- Used React's `use()` hook to unwrap async params
- Updated interface to `params: Promise<{ id: string }>`
- Changed all `params.id` references to use unwrapped `id`
- Cleared `.next` cache and restarted dev server

**Code Implementation:**
```typescript
import { use } from 'react'

interface EditRecipePageProps {
  params: Promise<{
    id: string
  }>
}

export default function EditRecipePage({ params }: EditRecipePageProps) {
  const { id } = use(params) // Unwrap async params
  // ... rest of component
}
```

### 2. All Page Layouts Harmonized ✅
- Landing page: Emerald/teal theme with appropriate font sizes
- Dashboard: Fits viewport without scrolling
- All recipe pages: Consistent color schemes matching meta cards
- Navigation: Consistent across all pages
