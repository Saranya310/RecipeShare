# 🔧 Complete Database Field Fix - All Review Components

**Issue:** All review-related components were using `review` field but the database table has `comment` field.

---

## 🐛 **Root Cause**

The `recipe_ratings` table in Supabase has a column named `comment`, but ALL application components were looking for a field named `review`.

**Database Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE recipe_ratings (
  id UUID DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4() PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL,
  recipe_id UUID REFERENCES recipes ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL,
  rating INTEGER CHECK (rating >= 1 AND rating <= 5) NOT NULL,
  comment TEXT,  -- ← This is the actual field name
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(user_id, recipe_id)
);
```

## ✅ **All Files Fixed**

### 1. `app/recipe-reviews/page.tsx` ✅
- **Interface:** `review: string | null` → `comment: string | null`
- **Display:** `review.review` → `review.comment`

### 2. `components/recipe-rating.tsx` ✅
- **Interface:** `review: string | null` → `comment: string | null`
- **State:** `newReview` → `newComment`
- **Database Operations:** `review: newReview.trim()` → `comment: newComment.trim()`
- **Display:** All `rating.review` → `rating.comment`

### 3. `app/my-reviews/page.tsx` ✅
- **Interface:** `review: string | null` → `comment: string | null`
- **Display:** `review.review` → `review.comment`

### 4. `app/reviews/page.tsx` ✅
